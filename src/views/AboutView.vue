                  Bangla continues to be the shared language of expression for a
                  considerable part of the global population (approximately, 250
                  million native speakers and 41 million second language
                  speakers) even though many of them, like us, continue to drift
                  away physically from the geographical area where it is a major
                  spoken and written language - primarily, in
                  <span class="text-midnight-sapphire">Bangladesh</span> and
                  some parts of
                  <span class="text-midnight-sapphire">India</span>. A corollary
                  to being a migrant or an expat is the often unintentional and
                  unnoticed assimilation in their adopted land(s) and
                  language(s) driven by the constant need of communication in a
                  non-native language in both professional spaces and social
                  circles. While this results in a certain ‘globalization’ of
                  Bangalis through the movement of people and ideas, it also
                  diminishes the presence of Bangla, the language, in our daily
                  parlance. Oftentimes, the language is relegated to silent
                  musings and nostalgic reveries of a world left behind. At
                  times, this is directly reflected through the lives of
                  second-generation Bangalis across the world for whom the
                  transition from a linguistic familiarity to a shared
                  collective identity remains a constant struggle. Yet certain
                  moments of collective engagement in Bangla, the language,
                  during religio-cultural events, family and friendly
                  gatherings, academic conferences, protest movements or even
                  social media interactions provide a sense of camaraderie in
                  lands far from home. This makes the language and its cultural
                  coordinates accessible to not only those who ethnically
                  identify as Bangali or use Bangla as their native language,
                  but also those who have adopted it through their mediated or
                  lived experiences.

                  remains untapped is an immensely diverse potential that
                  characterises Bangla as the cradle for a collective of
                  intersectional worldviews and not just a landmass or language.
                  The huge geographical presence of Bangla speakers implies that
                  this ‘worldview’ currently encompasses large swathes of the
                  globe. Therefore, the diverse - and many - ‘Bengals’ that
                  exist now could perhaps fully appreciate or explore their
                  modern multifarious contours and identities by forging
                  connections with Bangalis of different perspectives and across
                  different countries.

                We believe that nurturing the use of Bangla in a land away from
                home can only be effectivized if communicating and reading
                Bangla texts works in tandem with a platform for writing. A
                language like Bangla, that is not regularly deployed to map the
                new nodal points of enquiring the global order, may often lose
                out on dynamism of thought and a holistic worldview. Hence, the
                use of Bangla vocabulary as well as stretching its limits by
                introducing new forms of expression or refurbishing obscure ones
                is one of our primary initiatives. The long term goal of this
                initiative will be to ensure that such conversations in and
                around Bangla are recognized through a publication enterprise
                with an ISSN registration that will facilitate a literary
                exchange and develop an internationally standardized publication
                process.

                Based out of Canada, our network will primarily focus on
                building a platform of trilingual exchange in Bangla, French,
                and English. We believe that such a platform is required to
                posit Bangla as a world language in all its diverse formations
                including its specific dialects and creole forms. Furthermore,
                we intend to trace the historicity of international as well as
                intersectional exchange associated with Bangla. Going forward
                one of the primary objectives of the network will be to create a
                polyvocal space across class, caste, religious, gender, and
                other identities. We also intend to actively engage with
                indigenous languages and cultures beginning with North America
                but expanding into other parts of the world when the network
                develops bases in other continents.

                We believe that without a sense of Bangla, as a language and its
                literary lineage, it becomes quite difficult for the second and
                successive generations to negotiate questions of familial as
                well as linguistic identity. To put it broadly, it leads to a
                feeling of disconnection. Lack of linguistic knowledge also acts
                as an obstruction while accessing the historicity of literary or
                cultural productions in and around Bangla. Therefore, we have
                resolved to focus on providing a platform for Bangla language
                teaching. This will act as a platform that will bring first
                generation immigrants as teachers to engage with successive
                generations and other language enthusiasts as students in a
                classroom set-up.

                Tracing international and global experiences of Bangalis

              >
                One of our primary objectives is to identify the global and
                glocal existence(s) of Bangalis across the world - and in the
                geographical region of Bangla - in order to situate ourselves
                against the varied lived realities of these spaces. We start off
                as a venture of expats based out of Canada and would like to
                eventually grow as an international cultural emissary of
                Bangalis who will encourage and nurture art and culture in
                relation to their homeland(s). We would like to enter into
                dialogues with other migrant as well as expat Bangalis around
                the world to reflect on questions of symbiotic relationships
                with the different communities that we encounter during our
                voyage across the world.

            Our network is set to publish an online digital magazine. We
            sincerely hope that this magazine will begin as a trilingual
            platform of exchanging literary and cultural forms between Bangla,
            English, and French but eventually expand into an intersectional
            space of multilingual and polyvocal exchange.
